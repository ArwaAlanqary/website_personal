I am a M.Sc. in Computational Science and Engineering at MIT, advised by Devavrat Shah. Previously I worked at the [Center for Complex Systems (CCS)](https://jcep.kacst.edu.sa/center-main/ccs) at KACST and MIT. I am grateful for the support from KACST graduate scholarship. I earned my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Alfaisal University.
