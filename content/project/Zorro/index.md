<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Personal data is a key ingredient in showing web users targeted ads - the economic backbone of the internet. Still, there are two major inefficiencies in how such data is bought and sold online: 
<ol type="1">
  <li>Consumers do not get to: (a) decide what types of ads they get to see; (b) decide what personal information is released; (c) get paid for this privacy loss.</li>
  <li>Advertisers purchase consumer data without knowing how much value it provides, leading to somewhat arbitrary data contracts.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Zorro, is a web-based software platform that aims to rectify the aforementioned two problems. Zorro is instantiated as a Chrome web extension to prevent privacy loss and allow for user control over display ads. It has three main functionalities:
<ol type="1">
  <li>Replicates AdBlockPlus and prevents display ads from being shown.</li>
  <li>Replicates Google Chrome Incognito and prevents personal data from leaking to third parties. Importantly, it allows users to retain relevant login info for sites (e.g. Gmail, Facebook) </li>
  <li>Most importantly, it allows users to add intent (e.g. restaurants or events they would like to go to, products they want to buy, flights or hotels they need to purchase for an upcoming trip). Zorro only displays ads relevant to the inputted intent.</li>
</ol>
</div>
